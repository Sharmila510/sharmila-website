          kim Taehyung is a korean pop star.He is a singer in the very popoular
           group of BTS.He was born in Daegu, South Korea on December 30 1995.
          One thing I realy admire about Taehyung is he never try to or be like
           someonelse. He is only being himself.Never try to fit in society 
           perfection in trendy things.

          Taehyung was initially raised in Geochang County. He
           is the eldest son among the siblings; 
           his younger siblings include a brother and a sister. 
           In elementary school, Taehyung dreamed of being an expert singer. 
           To pursue his music career, he started taking saxophone instructions in the 
           first half of middle college with the encouragement given by his father.
           Following a successful audition in Daegu, V finally became a well-known
           name after getting a role as a trainee for Big Hit Entertainment.

             His name was going to be Dowoo,but his grandfather named him
              Taehyung. Taehyung means <strong> “All wishes will come true”</strong>
            He considers his dad as his biggest inspiration.
            He is an eldest of three children.
            He have two younger siblings,one brother and one sister.

           <p>
            <strong>V’s MOTTO:</strong> “I just came up with it but let’s life coolly to the maximum. Since the life happens only once, 
            waking up at ease in the morning and working doing your best.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He created <i>“I purple you”</i> or <i>“Borahae”</i>. According to him: “ Purple is last colour of rainbow,which means love which will last long and forever”.
          
           </p>
           <p>
            He chose V as his stage name because V stands for victory among six,lex and v.
            Taehyung is the Only one in the group who is ambidextrous(can write equally
            with both hands).His way of thinking is the most different and unique from others.
            Almost all the members have at least once said,or Been amazed by 
            Taehyung's different point of view.
